## `data/MAERT_lookup.csv`

Lookup table of all scraped MAERTs. A Regulated Entity can have more than one MAERT. A permit number can have more than one MAERT.

# The Process

## 1. Getting/scraping the full list of registered facilities, their metadata, and their permit numbers

Compile a list of registered facilities by searching with zipcode + county. \
zipcode: `data_liberation_project/texas_air/scripts/metadata_regulated_entities zipcode.py`\
county: `data_liberation_project/texas_air/scripts/metadata_regulated_entities.py`

## 2. For each permit number, scraping the TCEQ's document portal to fetch the particular kind of PDF that includes the allowable-emissions limits

Using data gathered from Step 1. Use `data_liberation_project/texas_air/python/collect_pdfs_for_regulated_entities.py` to scrape document portal via RN search.

The PDFs are stored under data/MAERT.

With a file naming convention of (`registeredEntitiesNumber`)\_(`PermitNumber`)\_(`dateModified`)\_(`scrapeDate`).pdf
EX:`RN111577540_170526_12-8-2023_1712015282.pdf`

## 3. Extracting that table of emissions limits from the PDFs into structured data/Standardizing that data

`COLUMNS = ["Emission Source","Source Name", "Air Contaminant Name", "Emission Rate lbs/hr", "Emission Rate tons/year"]`

MAERT are extracted via the following schema.

The [PDF Plumber iPython Notebook](/table_extraction/pdf_plumber.ipynb) is used to extract tables from the pdfs.

Using two strategies

- extract_table()
- custom formatter at [tricky_tables.py](/table_extraction/tricky_tables.py)

The final file lives at `data/final.csv`

# Document Statistics

Extraction strategies were successful in documents spanning over all years.

Starting in 1992, friendly formatted PDFs appeared (under category easy). It seems that wide adoption of friendly formatted PDFs unfortunately didn't persist.

Easy Tables + Tricky Tables were extracted.
Unknown Tables were not possible to extract.
